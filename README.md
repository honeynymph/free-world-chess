A free global chess rating system that's decentralized using cryptography. 

The current global chess organization is rife with ethical and social issues. We need a decentralized system to keep chess chess and politics politics. I propose creating such a system using cryptography. I see this working using a few different components: 

a) Every player has a secret key which they use to prove they are that player -- perhaps they use a new one for every change. 
b) Every player can do a simple check to ensure that the version of the ratings they have is the most current and therefore most accurate. 
c) Typically it's proof-of-work that makes b) possible and public key crypto that makes a) possible -- at least with cryptocurrency.

I hope we can change chess for the better. This would really do it.
